As of September 2025, I am an associate professor in the Mathematics department of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Athens, Greece).

I completed my PhD in RISC - Research Institute for Symbolic Computation  under the supervision of 
[Prof. Peter Paule](https://risc.jku.at/m/peter-paule/) (JKU, Austria) and 
[Prof. Matthias Beck](https://matthbeck.github.io) (SFSU, USA).

After that, I worked in RISC, in the Informatics and Telecommunications department of National University of Athens (Athens, Greece) 
and the Mathematics department of Galatasaray University (Istanbul, Turkey) as a postdoc. 

From 2016 to 2022, I was an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering department of Gebze Technical University (Gebze, Turkey).

After that, I was a ma√Ætre assistant in the Mathematics department of University of Geneva (Geneva, Switzerland) in the
Eccellenza project of [Prof. Jehanne Dousse](https://www.unige.ch/~doussej/) for 2 years and a researcher in the ELIDEK project of Prof. Maria Chlouveraki in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Athens, Greece).

I serve as the Information Director of the [SIG Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (ACM SIGSAM)](http://sigsam.org) 
and associate editor of [ACM Communications in Computer Algebra (ACM CCA)](https://www.sigsam.org/cca/).
I am also a member of ACM SIGACT and SIAM Activity Groups on Optimization, Algebraic Geometry, and Applied and Computational Discrete Algorithm.

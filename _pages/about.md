I completed my PhD in RISC - Research Institute for Symbolic Computation  under the supervision of 
[Prof. Peter Paule](https://risc.jku.at/m/peter-paule/)(JKU, Austria) and 
[Prof. Matthias Beck](https://matthbeck.github.io) (SFSU, USA).

After that, I worked in RISC, in the Informatics and Telecommunications department of National University of Athens (Athens, Greece) 
and the Mathematics department of Galatasaray University (Istanbul, Turkey) as postdoc. 

From 2016 ato 2022, I was an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering department of Gebze Technical University (Gebze, Turkey).

As of January 2023, I am a ma√Ætre assistant in the Mathematics department of University of Geneva (Geneva, Switzerland) in the
Eccellenza project of [Prof. Jehanne Dousse](https://www.unige.ch/~doussej/).

I serve as the Information Director of the [SIG Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (ACM SIGSAM)](http://sigsam.org) 
and associate editor of [ACM Communications in Computer Algebra (ACM CCA)](https://www.sigsam.org/cca/).

In July 2025, the international conference ["Applications of Computer Algebra - ACA"](https://zafeirakopoulos.github.io/ACA2025/) 
will take place in Heraklion (Crete, Greece). We welcome special session proposals!

I completed my PhD in RISC - Research Institute for Symbolic Computation  under the supervision of 
[Prof. Peter Paule](https://risc.jku.at/m/peter-paule/)(JKU, Austria) and 
[Prof. Matthias Beck](https://matthbeck.github.io) (SFSU, USA).

After that, I worked in RISC, National University of Athens (Athens, Greece) 
and Galatasaray University (Istanbul, Turkey) as postdoc and Gebze Technical University (Gebze, Turkey) as assistant professor.

As of January 2023, I am a ma√Ætre assistant at University of Geneva (Switzerland) in the
Eccellenza project of [Prof. Jehanne Dousse](https://www.unige.ch/~doussej/).

I serve as the Information Director of the [SIG Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (ACM SIGSAM)](http://sigsam.org).

### Seminars

Disseminating both new results and new perspectives on known topics is best done through seminars.
Here is a selection of seminar talks:

### IMU project "Training Mathematicians in Computation"

The project's goal was to organize a series of "Experimental Mathematics Meetings" in different cities in Turkey, training mathematicians in computational methods.
 
### Nesin Math Village (Nesin Matematik Köyü)

The [Nesin Math Village](https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/nesin-maths-village/) is a village near Selcuk (Izmir, Turkey), where people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy mathematics.

Every summer there is a summer school for undergraduate and graduate (mostly math) students with a very large variety of course topics.
Since 2010 I have been teaching courses (1 or 2 weeks of lectures) related to computational aspects of mathematics whenever possible: 

Polynomial System Solving (2010), Solving Linear Diophantine Systems (2011), Geometry and Number Theory (2012), Geometry that counts (2015), 
Algorithmic Algebraic Geometry (2015), Symbolic Computation (2016), Combinatorial Counting (2017), Introduction to Polyhedral Geometry (2018),
Polyhedral Combinatorics (2019), Symbolic Computation (2022).

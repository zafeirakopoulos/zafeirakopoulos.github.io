### Undergraduate Theses

I have supervised more than 40 graduation (senior year) theses in Gebze Technical University computer
engineering department and 2 graduation theses in the Galatasaray University math department.


## Outreach 

### IMU project "Training Mathematicians in Computation"

The project's goal was to organize a series of workshops in different cities in Turkey, training mathematicians in computational methods.
 
### Nesin Math Village (Nesin Matematik Koyu)

The Nesin Math Village is a village near Selcuk (Izmir, Turkey), where people of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy mathematics.

Every summer there is a summer school for undergraduate and graduate (mostly math) students with a very large variety of course topics.
Since 2010 I have been teaching courses related to computational aspects of mathematics whenever possible.
